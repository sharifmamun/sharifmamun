### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Working on large scale distributed systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning algorithms and models as part of my Masters program at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning.
- ðŸ”­ Playing with supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My handle is sharifmamun for almost all popular emails/social medias/services.
- âš¡ Fun fact:
      - Once upon a time, I used to work on research projects and published papers even on neural networks when AI/ML was not this hot. My Google scholar profile: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eVw2pA4AAAAJ&hl=en
      - I used to attend Pycons in my 20s, received Pycon financial grants to attend Pycon 2015 (in Montreal), Pycon 2016 (in Portland). I was fortunate to have a long conversation with Guido and experienced the simplicity and humbleness of the Python creator.

Happy coding!
